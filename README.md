Linking local movements to change or move a National issue 

test case: national fiber

The new idea here is to use all the latest technologies of the internet that are free and open source and build the rest.
It is time to rise up (engineers and political activiist), link all the towns, counties, cities and other political supervisiorial units.

Train the active residents to attend supervisor votes (don't buss in out of towners, they can protest from the outside buildling :D ).

Bringing everyone fiber is not an easy issue, but I think if a local movments with national support we may be able to change our local laws that can make it happen.

I am not a leader, a starter maybe. I've got more ideas but I'd rather see people fork and add what they think we need first.

# Truth and Trust
## Truth
  I have no background in this subject. My guess is GPG sign data and a blockchain could be used, plus linking data (videos, pics, measurements) in the block chain somehow. Finally the Trust SHA key should be linked in so we can trust the person who is trying to prove the truth of something.
  
  Think this example, someone is measuring the distance between their neighborhood and a proposed central office for a fibre install so someone else can calculate the cost. All this info needs to be true so people can take this info to their elected officials. If the said people had some way to show photos and the measurements were taken by someone trusted or the data can be considered true than it will have more weight at either a hearing or at the officials office.
  
Of course this help with news too, references and verifications will help people trust what is spread to other people. Like successes and failures of efforts of neighboring communities. 

## Trust
  This is a well documented and researched subject.  
  It is an important for a well executed plan spanning the country. I believe SHA keys used in software verfication like GITHUB would work well here
