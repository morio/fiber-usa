Linking local movements to change or move a National issue 

test case: national fiber

The new idea here is to use all the latest technologies of the internet that are free and open source and build the rest.
It is time to rise up (engineers and political activiist), link all the towns, counties, cities and other political supervisiorial units.

Train the active residents to attend supervisor votes (don't buss in out of towners, they can protest from the outside buildling :D ).

Bringing everyone fiber is not an easy issue, but I think if a local movments with national support we may be able to change our local laws that can make it happen.

I am not a leader, a starter maybe. I've got more ideas but I'd rather see people fork and add what they think we need first.
